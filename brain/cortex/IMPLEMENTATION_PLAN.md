## Active Task Contracts

### Phase 0: Bootstrap Verification

- [ ] **0.1** Verify Ralph loop is operational
  - **Goal:** Ensure Ralph can execute basic tasks
  - **Context:** Fresh project setup, need to validate infrastructure
  - **AC:**
    - [ ] Run `bash brain/workers/ralph/loop.sh` completes without errors
    - [ ] Verifier runs and produces `.verify/latest.txt`
    - [ ] brain/workers/ralph/THUNK.md created with first entry
  - **If Blocked:** Check loop.sh syntax, verifier rules, file permissions

- [ ] **0.2** Document project structure in NEURONS.md
  - **Goal:** Validate and refine NEURONS.md generated structure
  - **Context:** Generated NEURONS.md may need project-specific adjustments
  - **AC:**
    - [ ] All directories in "Directory Structure" exist or are planned
    - [ ] Key files are documented with purpose
    - [ ] Tech-specific guidance is accurate
  - **If Blocked:** Refer to project idea file for intended structure

### Phase 1: Core Setup

(Tasks to be added by Cortex based on project goals)

---

## Notes for Ralph

- This is your first project with Cortex management
- Check `brain/cortex/THOUGHTS.md` for strategic context
- Tasks live in `brain/workers/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Focus on one task per iteration (atomic completion)
